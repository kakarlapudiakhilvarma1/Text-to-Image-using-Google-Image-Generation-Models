# Text-to-Image-using-Google-Image-Generation-Models
This application uses Google Vertex AI - Google Image Generation models to convert the given text into images, also here we have capabilities to select a few ratio aspects and no of images to be generated.

# Image Generation using Google Imagen 3.0

This project is a simple Streamlit-based web application that generates images using Google Cloud's Imagen 3.0 model.

## Features

- Generates AI-generated images from text prompts.
- Supports multiple aspect ratios.
- Allows users to specify the number of images.
- Interactive Streamlit UI for an easy user experience.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Google Cloud account with Vertex AI enabled
- Streamlit installed
- Google Cloud SDK installed and authenticated

### Set Up Google Cloud Authentication
